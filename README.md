# opamp

>This project has been superseded by [a1-server] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/a1-server)

>If you are using `opamp`, please replace the dependency to `a1-server` to get the latest updates.

To prevent updating because of new vinlerabilities on dependencies and dev-dependencies, the package.json is now free of deps.

The name of the project will still be alivein order to reuse it in the future (opamp is much better than a1-server)
